# Todolist backend with Spring Boot

In my interest to learn Java, I created a functioning backend for https://minimaltodo.com/ using Spring Boot and Hibernate.

Everything was learned in the course of a week, and I enjoyed the process enormously.

The reason why the current minimaltodo.com backend is not written with Java was because I did not manage to run the app on the server (causing a server overload and saturating the MySQL or Postgress databases -- i tried both.)

If anyone would like to help me understand why, or help me configure, please reach out to me -- you can find my email on https://nico.kupfer.es/contact

Much appreciated 🙏
